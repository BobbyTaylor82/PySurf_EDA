<b>Project Objective:</b> In this project, the goal was to understand basic sqlalchemy and how it can be used to query db's using python. After all the queries were performed, a Flask api was built using all the information collected during the analysis.

Tools Used: 
<ul>
<li>DB Browser for Sqlite </li>
<li>Jupyter notebook</li>
<li> Tableau</li>
<li> Excel </li>
</ul>

libraries used:
<ul>
<li>sqlalchemy </li>
<li>pandas </li>
<li>numpy </li>
<li>seaborn </li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
</ul>

### In 2016, the average temperature in Hawaii was 74.1 ¬∞F with variation of +/- 19.9 ¬∞F. This sounds like perfect weather to me. 

```python
Hawaii gets two üëç üëçand two raised ‚úã ‚úã.
```

<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
<p>While performing an eda for the hawaii sqlite database, I noticed a few different observations. The findings are below:. </p>
<h4><u>Findings</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, the average temperature in Hawaii was 74.1 ¬∞F with variation of +/- 19.9 ¬∞F.</li> 
<p><li> All the stations, in this datebase where located in O ªahu. There seems to be a positive relationship between the number of observations and location. The stations with the most obseravations where located along the coastline.</li><br>
<li>USC00519281 is the most active station in O'ahu located in Mililani Town.</li>
    <li>The total prcp for all stations in 2016 was 372 inches.</li>
</ul>
